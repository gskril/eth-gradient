# ETH Gradient

Derive a gradient SVG from an Ethereum address.

Currently, two different SVGs are created using numbers from the Ethereum address and exported to `/test` for easy viewing, one using HSL and the other RGB. 

Eventually we'll settle on one method but this seemed easiest for quick visualizations.
