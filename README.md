# ETH Gradient

Derive a gradient SVG from an Ethereum address.

## Testing

An Ethereum address is converted into an array of numbers which are used to create colors in a gradient. Currently, this happens on a handful of addresses simultaneously to easily visualize the output across a set. The SVG's are saved to `/test`.
